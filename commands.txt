git add # The git add command adds a change in the working directory to the staging area. It tells Git that you want to include updates to a particular file in the next commit. However, git add doesn't really affect the repository in any significant wayâ€”changes are not actually recorded until you run git commit .

git commit 
git push # commit saves the changes only to the local repository but not to the remote repository. Git push updates your committed changes and allows you to send them to the remote repository where all of the developers can access them.
